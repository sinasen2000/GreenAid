<!-- An example of how you can do a sprint review -->

# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Multiple members were too late
During the lab, multiple people arrived too late. This interfered with the meeting that was scheduled at that moment and it had to be postponed.

To mitigate this, a cake rule was added to push members to be on time

## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Increase testing effort
    - This was not achieved. New agreements have been made.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Increase testing effort
 - Add cake rule
