# Sprint Review/Week 5

## Things we've done
- Decision to keep the data for saved CO2 locally, in our database
- Big changes to database (tables, relationships etc)
- Improved connection DB - Server
- Script found for generating Java classes from DB tables

## Main problems  Encountered
- Not everyone participated our non-obligatory meeting
- The script generator had to be modified (and still needs some improvements)
- Since DB is modified we need to update the server as well

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- We have a better overview of our application
- Better DB

## Adjustments for next sprint
- Faster progress
- Focus on the next demo
