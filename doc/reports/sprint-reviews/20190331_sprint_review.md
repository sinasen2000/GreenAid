# Sprint Review/Week 7

## Things we've done
- Huge code refactoring (removing useless imports, moving some methods from/to other classes)
- Mockito used successfully on the local DB (no need of a real connection anymore for tests)
- Added the Leaderboard and Friends panels in GUI
- Solving some methods problems (getLeaderboard method)
- Implementing Info tab in GUI
- Completing test coverage
- Adding a new DB trigger for removeActivity

## Main problems Encountered
- Refactoring was hard, but Sven managed to finish this task successfully
- Some old bugs (getLeaderboard return type)

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- We have lots of improvements in our application
- The code is very organized now

## Adjustments for next sprint
- Keep it like this!
