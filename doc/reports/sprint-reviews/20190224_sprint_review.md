# Sprint Review/Week 2

## Opening/Teamwork
First week, Tomasso couldn't show up on meetings as he was at Italy, Germio also
missed the first meeting, but came to all other meetings.

Sven missed week 3 due to a flat tyre in between Rotterdam and Delft.

However, all of them reported our TA and also talked with the student counselor, so no problem.

Also, everyone appeared in our extra meetings.

The communication inside our team is excellent so far and everyone behaves according to the schedules and deadlines.
 We also get along with each other excluding the professional team talks, which is a nice sign of team chemistry.

## Main problems encountered during this Spring

### 1- Dealing with dependencies/libraries/frameworks
We experienced so much hardship on dealing with .idea folder and pom.xml file. It was actually harder than coding itself at some point.
Other than that, it was also painful to get maven working to do mvn site and get the checkstyle report. 
It was also a bit hard to adjust the code according to checkstyle warnings but it gave us another perspective in terms of code quality and
we feel like we've learned so much from it. 

### 2- Sourcetree(?)
At some points, our Sourcetree worked weirdly, or we thought it is working weirdly as none of us are really proficient at Git. But it is good that we only had one Merge Conflict and we solved it successfully.

## Things that we've done well
- Our planning was clear this week, although we could've finished everything earlier and focus on something else.
- Roles of each team member was also really clear. Everyone was participant and responsible on their tasks. 
- So far we have a basic Server, Client, a connection between them, a database (although it is not connected to app yet), full tests and test coverage on classes, 
checkstyle report.

## Things to improve for the next sprint 
- We need to think more on 'creative' side of the project. Also, we can get faster on everything to add more features to the project. 
- Getting better and faster on dealing with git
