#### MEETING 15/02/2019
GitLab and SCRUM will be used to show priorities, deadlines,…
-	How the project will run, guidelines,…

Adding a meeting on Saturday ? (optional ?)

Goal of the week (till next meeting):
-	Doing research
-	Working on the content of the app

Updating README doc on GitLab was the main goal of the meeting  a quarter of it was used to understand how SourceTree works
-	Understanding on how to commit, branch, pull, push changes in the documents of the project (which was README for today).

We discussed about the application, its features, etc.
-	We’ve brainstormed about it: the brainstorm included
o	What will the application contain?
o	How will it be designed?
o	What does the application would do ?
o	Will we use an API or not ?
o	Etc

Basically, this lab was used to get started with everything. Everything contains:
-	Installing the application (mostly SourceTree),
-	Creating an SSH key
-	Getting started with SourceTree
-	Updating the README file and actually figuring out how to do it by using SourceTree
-	Brainstorming on the very first steps of the application (how will it work, what will it contain…)


Specific notes on the application’s content:
1.	Global lists by saved CO2
2.	History of the activities you’ve done
3.	Add activity button
4.	Search & add friends (inside the “friends” button)
5.	Authentication & profile picture
6.	Achievements & badges that give you XP
7.	Leader boards with friends
8.	Level, based on XP

REMINDER: this is a first impression on how the application will contains ! Stuff will be added as well as removed.

Levelling:
We thought it would be better to level up by using the number of achievements you’ve done, not the number of CO2 you’ve managed to spare.
