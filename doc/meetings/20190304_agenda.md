# Meeting 4
> Quoted text will give you extra pointers to how an agenda should look like

## Opening
> Everyone is in the meeting. Tavi joined us at around 11 because she needed to pick his girlfriend up from airport.

## Approval of the agenda
> Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.

## Things to discuss
- Creation of user profile, linking user profile to the database so that name, location, age and such can be shown in user's profile.
- Learning how to create queries in Java/Spring
- After user profile creation, we need to focus on activity adding.
- Deciding on recommendation algorithm usage
- GUI connection to the app
- Continuous Integration
- Talk about milestones and update (if necessary)
- Assign a person for "proof of choice" for any framework or strategy
- Review SPRINT
- Prepare next SPRINT
- Ask the TA for feedback (SPRINT board, labels)

## Any other business
> If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.

## Question round
> If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.

## Closing
> Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!
