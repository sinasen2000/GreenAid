# Agenda 11/03/2019

## Opening
Check if everyone is in the meeting.

## Things we did this week:
- Completed a more advanced authentication and authorization that is also connected to the database.

- Turned the database tables to classes of Java (mapping)

- Reorganised the database in order to have more sustainable schemas and relations for further steps of development. 

- Meanwhile, proof of choice is being written by Sina.

- Now, we also store "Amount of CO2 saved" and "XP Points" values of each activity in the database. We made this design choice for the sake of planning and application as we could not find any better API for our purpose.


## For the next week

MUST DOs:
- ADD Activity part of the GUI, where user clicks a button to add an activity. 
- Upon pressing the button, application sends a json request to the server to add that activity to user's profile, then server communicates with the database and writes the value to the corresponding table of database.
- After adding the activity, on closing and reopening the application, the activity will stay at user's profile, i.e after getting authorized, the values will still be there.
- Tests for each and every class except GUI
- Jacoco reports for the code
- Checkstyle reports for the code


## Questions

- AutoDev Ops not enabled in our project.

GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE
