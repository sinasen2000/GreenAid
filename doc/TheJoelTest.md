# The Joel Test

## Do you use source control?

Yes, we use GitLab and SourceTree to utilize source control and allow each team member to work in sync.

## Can you make a build in one step?

Not applicable. 

## Do you make daily builds?

Yes, we both have CI/CD and we also do daily builds to ensure our code is well-developed.

## Do you have a bug database?

Yes, you can reach our bug/error database in our ReadMe file.

## Do you fix bugs before writing new code?

Of course! We try to eliminate all sorts of bugs and errors in order to prevent unsustainable development.

## Do you have an up-to-date schedule?

Yes, we stick to our deadlines and also we got all points from the demos.

## Do you have a spec?

Unfortunately, we don't have a spec because we learned what it is or how to create it later on the project.

## Do programmers have quiet working conditions?

Yes, we recommend Pulse Technology Room.

## Do you use the best tools money can buy?

Unfortunately, this is not applicable in our case so we assume that we got this one, too.

## Do you have testers?

Yes, it's a requirement :)

## Do new candidates write code during their interview?

Not applicable, again.

## Do you do hallway usability testing?

Yes, hallway usability testing asserts that getting feedback from 5 people should be enough, so we just did that. (We asked permission to use their names for privacy.)

Here are the results:
